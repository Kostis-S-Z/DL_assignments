## TODO:

- Do a grid search to find good values for the amount of regularization, the
learning rate and the batch size. There is some significant empirical evidence
that training with smaller batch sizes when using SGD training leads to better
generalization.


## Features:

- Early stopping
- Shuffling data samples every epoch
