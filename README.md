Deep Learning DD2424 @ KTH 2019 Assignments

### Assignment 1: Building a Neural Network from scratch

The goal of this assignment was to build a Single Layer Neural Network from scratch and train it on the popular image dataset CIFAR-10. The learning algorithm used was mini-batch gradient descent.

##### Features:

- Choice between Cross-entropy and SVM Multi-class loss function
- L2 Regularisation
- Early stopping
- Shuffling data samples every epoch
- Grid Search for optimal hyper parameter tuning
- Plot loss progress & learnt class representations (weight matrices)

##### TODO:

- Fix SVM Multi-class loss


### Assignment 2: Expanding to a Two-Layer Neural Network

Next, we expand the network to use two layers and cyclical learning rates.

##### Features:

- Pre-process data to a zero mean
- Cyclical Learning rates

##### Features:

##### TODO:
