## TODO:

- Implement early stopping: Train for a longer time and use your validation set to make sure you donâ€™t
overfit or to keep a record of the best model before you begin to overfit.

- Shuffle the order of your training examples at the beginning of every epoch.

- Do a grid search to find good values for the amount of regularization, the
learning rate and the batch size. There is some significant empirical evidence
that training with smaller batch sizes when using SGD training leads to better
generalization.
